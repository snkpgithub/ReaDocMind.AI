## 🔍 How **DeepSeek** Works in ReaDocMind.AI
**DeepSeek LLM** is an advanced AI model that powers document understanding and question-answering in ReadMind.AI. Here's how it works:

1. **PDF Processing**: The document text is extracted using **PDFPlumber**.
2. **Text Chunking & Embeddings**: The extracted text is broken into smaller chunks and converted into vector representations using **DeepSeek embeddings**.
3. **Vector Search**: When a user asks a question, the app searches for relevant document chunks using similarity search.
4. **AI-Powered Answering**: The retrieved context is fed into **DeepSeek LLM**, which generates concise and factual responses.
5. **Interactive UI**: The processed information is displayed in a conversational chat interface for easy readability.

DeepSeek enhances **accuracy, relevance, and AI reasoning**, making ReadMind.AI a **powerful research assistant**.
